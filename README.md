# Yelp-Clone

This is a pretty simple CRUD Yelp Clone which adds restaurants and reviews to a postgreSQL database and updates the UI accordingly along with the restaurants rating average.

Tech used: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js, Boostrap, Node-Postgre, and Context API Storage.

This project really allowed me to put together a complete CRUD app from start to finish. Some of the spacing and color isn't as good as I would have hoped for because I'm still learning the bootstrap classes, but all in all it went well. Most notably, I came to realize how important it is to build larger applications. Building larger applications forces you think about writing cleaner code and organizing your project in a manner that would make sense to follow. The thing I'm most proud of in this project is the amount of documentation I read and was able to follow. That in itself is a critical skill for any developer and I definitely improved on this throughout this project.

Optimizations
If I had more time on this project I would definitely work on the color scheme of my pages, they were very basic and I could have improved upon them with a little more React code. Overall, that wasn't the focus of this project, but it's something I might go back to in the future to improve.
