# Yelp-Clone

Hi there!

This repo contains a CRUD Yelp clone which adds restaurants and reviews to a postgreSQL database and updates the UI accordingly. It also allows you to read past reviews and gives you an average rating of all the restaurants in the database.

Tech used: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js, Boostrap, Node-Postgres Library, and Context API Storage.

This project allowed me to put together a complete CRUD app from start to finish. Some of the spacing and color isn't as good as I would have hoped for because I'm still learning the bootstrap classes, but all in all it went well. Most notably, I came to realize how important it is to build larger applications. Building larger applications forces you think about writing cleaner code and organizing your project in a manner that would make sense to follow. The thing I'm most proud of in this project is the amount of documentation I read and was able to follow. That in itself is a critical skill for any developer and I definitely improved on this throughout this project.

Optimizations:

If I had more time on this project I would definitely work on the color scheme of my pages, they were very basic and I could have improved upon them with a little more React code. Overall, that wasn't the focus of this project, but it's something I might go back to in the future to improve.

Lessons learned: 

The main thing I learned building this app was postgreSQL, I had mainly used MongoDB for all my previous projects. It's very different, but an incredibly powerful database. I can see why it's so popular.
